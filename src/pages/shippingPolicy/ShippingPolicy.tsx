          Shipping Policy Thank you for shopping with us! We offer shipping
          services to customers located in Georgia and select international
          countries. Below are the details of our shipping policy. Processing
          Time: All orders are processed within 1-2 business days after they are
          placed. Orders are not shipped or delivered on weekends or holidays.
          If we are experiencing a high volume of orders, shipments may be
          delayed by a few days. Please allow additional days in transit for
          delivery. Shipping Rates & Delivery Estimates: Shipping charges for
          your order will be calculated and displayed at checkout based on the
          weight of your order and your shipping location. We offer both
          standard and express shipping options, with delivery estimates ranging
          from 2-7 business days depending on your location. International
          Shipping: We offer international shipping to select countries. Please
          note that international shipments may be subject to import duties and
          taxes, which are the responsibility of the customer. We recommend that
          you contact your local customs office for more information before
          placing your order. Order Tracking: Once your order has shipped, you
          will receive a shipping confirmation email with a tracking number that
          you can use to track your package. Shipping Carriers: We work with
          reputable shipping carriers to ensure that your package is delivered
          safely and on time. Our shipping carriers include [insert names of
          shipping carriers]. Shipping Restrictions: We currently do not offer
          shipping to P.O. boxes or APO/FPO addresses. Additionally, we reserve
          the right to refuse or cancel any orders that we believe may be
          fraudulent or in violation of our terms of service. If you have any
          questions or concerns about our shipping policy, please do not
          hesitate to contact us. Please note that this is just an example and
          you may need to modify the text to fit your specific business needs
          and shipping arrangements.
